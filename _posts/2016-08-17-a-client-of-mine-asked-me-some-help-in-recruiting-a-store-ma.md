A client of mine asked me some help in recruiting a store manager and marketing representative. This is a junior position, the likely candidate is a recent graduate with little work experience.

The employer is a leading franchisor in China, with hundreds entertainment venues around the country and over 10000 employees. One of the companies within this holding group is launching a new franchise format for wine retail shops in Shenzhen and are recruiting some of the first staff.

They are looking for a bilingual Expat with strong Mandarin and English and past experiences either studying or living in China. Specific work experience is not a requirement, but knowledge regarding the living and business environment of China is expected.

It is not necessary to have any wine knowledge, as there will be adequate training available. Liking wine, some personal culture or any certification in this regard are obvious advantages.

You will be asked to live and work in the first store to be opened (the opening is expected in October 2016) located in Shenzhen OCT. You will also be asked to travel often around China in a marketing role to convert prospects in franchisees.

As you will be one of the first hires in a chain expected to grow quickly in the number of stores, there are strong career opportunities.

In case you are interested please hit me with an email at:
